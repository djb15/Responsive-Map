Map Project

This project is a map showing all of my favourite places to eat in London and calculating the time to get there using the CityMapper API.

To run this project clone the directory and simply open the main.html file in a browser. For location services to work when testing in mobile mode with chrome run the app with python -m SimpleHTTPServer [port number]
